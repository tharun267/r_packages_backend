As of 2/27/2018 this paper has been submitted and is under scientific review. Using high-dimensional datasets to measure a subject’s overall level of abnormality as compared to a reference population is often needed in outcomes research. Utilizing applications in instrumented gait analysis, that article demonstrates how using data that is inherently non-independent to measure overall abnormality may bias results. A methodology is introduced to address this bias to accurately measure overall abnormality in high dimensional spaces. While this methodology is in line with previous literature, it differs in two major ways. Advantageously, it can be applied to datasets in which the number of observations is less than the number of features/variables, and it can be abstracted to practically any number of domains or dimensions. After applying the proposed methodology to the original data, the researcher is left with a set of uncorrelated variables (i.e. principal components) with which overall abnormality can be measured without bias. Different considerations are discussed in that article in deciding the appropriate number of principal components to keep and the aggregate distance measure to utilize.","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"5.0.1","Packaged":"2018-02-28 18:33:39 UTC; marks","Author":"Michael Marks [aut, cre]","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2018-03-13 17:42:56 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/abnormality_0.1.0.tar.gz"},{"Package":"abodOutlier","Version":"0.1","Depends":"cluster, R (>= 3.1.2)","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","MD5sum":"e3782e42842fc893d036bdfb7fd86d91","NeedsCompilation":"no","Title":"Angle-Based Outlier Detection","Author":"Jose Jimenez <jose@jimenezluna.com>","Maintainer":"Jose Jimenez <jose@jimenezluna.com>","Description":"Performs angle-based outlier detection on a given dataframe.

For the least-square estimation, the estimating equation is solved with generalized estimating equations (GEE). Moreover, in multivariate cases, the dependence working correlation structure can be specified in GEE's setting. Details on the least-squares estimation can be found in Chiou et al.

Over the past 8 years, the project has grown into a suite of related R packages that enhance and simplify the quantitative analysis of soil profile data. Central to the AQP project is a new vocabulary of specialized functions and data structures that can accommodate the inherent complexity of soil profile information; freeing the scientist to focus on ideas rather than boilerplate data processing tasks <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020>.

It is also commonly called 'the Acceptance-Rejection method' or 'Accept-Reject algorithm' and is a type of Monte Carlo method. 'Acceptance-Rejection method' is based on the observation that to sample a random variable one can perform a uniformly random sampling of the 2D cartesian graph, and keep the samples in the region under the graph of its density function. Package 'AR' is able to generate/simulate random data from a probability density function by Acceptance-Rejection method. Moreover, this package is a useful teaching resource for graphical presentation of Acceptance-Rejection method. From the practical point of view, the user needs to calculate a constant in Acceptance-Rejection method, which package 'AR' is able to compute this constant by optimization tools. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the graphical presentation for the Acceptance-Rejection Method.","Packaged":"2018-05-02 02:33:02 UTC; Parchami","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2018-05-02 03:54:28 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/AR_1.1.tar.gz"},{"Package":"ARCensReg","Version":"2.1","Imports":"mvtnorm, tmvtnorm, msm, numDeriv, utils, graphics, stats","Suggests":"SMNCensReg","License":"GPL (>= 2)","MD5sum":"9de99b988474346f938fb2229567539c","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":["Fitting Univariate Censored Linear Regression Model with","Autoregressive Errors"],"Date":"2016-09-10","Author":"Fernanda L.

The major methods include univariate autoregressive cokriging and multivariate autoregressive cokriging.

For hierarchically nested design, the model parameters are estimated via standard optimization algorithms; For non-nested design, the model parameters are estimated via Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithms. In both cases, the priors are chosen such that the posterior distributions are proper. Notice that the uniform priors on range parameters in the correlation function lead to improper posteriors. This should be avoided when Bayesian analysis is adopted. The development of objective priors for autoregressive cokriging models can be found in Pulong Ma (2019) <arXiv:1910.10225>.

Analysis output includes full posterior samples as well as posterior probabilities, highest posterior density (HPD) interval boundaries, effective sample sizes (ESS), mean and median estimations, posterior exchangeability probability matrices, and maximum a posteriori MEMs. In addition to providing \"basketwise\" analyses, the package includes similar calculations for \"clusterwise\" analyses for which subgroups are combined into meta-baskets, or clusters, using graphical clustering algorithms that treat the posterior exchangeability probabilities as edge weights.

Provides new methods for the so-called Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. The ultimate aim of FROC analysis is to compare observer performances, which means comparing characteristics, such as area under the curve (AUC) or figure of merit (FOM). In this package, we only use the notion of AUC for modality comparison, where by \"modality\",  we mean imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), ..., etc. So there is a problem that which imaging method is better to detect lesions from shadows in radiographs. To solve modality comparison issues, this package provides new methods using hierarchical Bayesian models proposed by the author of this package. Using this package, one can obtain at least one conclusion that which imaging methods are better for finding lesions in radiographs with the case of your data. Fitting FROC statistical models is sometimes not so good, it can easily confirm by drawing FROC curves and comparing these curves and the points constructed by False Positive fractions (FPFs) and True Positive Fractions (TPFs), we can validate the goodness of fit intuitively. Such validation is also implemented by the Chi square goodness of fit statistics in the Bayesian context which means that the parameter is not deterministic, thus by integrating it with the posterior predictive measure, we get a desired value. To compare modalities (imaging methods: MRI, CT, PET, ... , etc),  we evaluate AUCs for each modality. FROC is developed by Dev Chakraborty, his FROC model in his 1989 paper relies on the maximal likelihood methodology. The author modified and provided the alternative Bayesian FROC model. Strictly speaking, his model does not coincide with models in this package. In FROC context, we means by multiple reader and multiple case (MRMC) the case of the number of reader or modality is two or more. The MRMC data is available for functions of this package. I hope that medical researchers use not only the frequentist method but also alternative Bayesian methods. In medical research, many problems are considered under only frequentist methods, such as the notion of p-values. But p-value is sometimes misunderstood. Bayesian methods provide very simple, direct, intuitive answer for research questions. Combining frequentist methods with Bayesian methods, we can obtain more reliable answer for research questions.

The approach to nonstationary modeling involves a closed-form, convolution-based covariance function with spatially-varying parameters; these parameter processes can be specified either deterministically (using covariates or basis functions) or stochastically (using approximate Gaussian processes). Stationary Gaussian processes are a special case of our methodology, and we furthermore implement approximate Gaussian process inference to account for very large spatial data sets (Finley, et al (2017) <arXiv:1702.00434v2>). Bayesian inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods via the 'nimble' package, and posterior prediction for the Gaussian process at unobserved locations is provided as a post-processing step.","Date":"2019-10-12","Maintainer":"Daniel Turek <dbt1@williams.edu>","Author":"Daniel Turek, Mark Risser","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"6.1.1","Packaged":"2019-10-12 09:24:14 UTC; dturek","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2019-10-12 09:50:02 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/BayesNSGP_0.1.1.tar.gz"},{"Package":"BayesPieceHazSelect","Version":"1.1.0","Depends":"mvtnorm","License":"GPL-2","MD5sum":"596b886312e1771728ead04192bff74d","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":["Variable Selection in a Hierarchical Bayesian Model for a Hazard","Function"],"Authors@R":"person(\"Andrew\", \"Chapple\", email = \"AndrewChapple21@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))","Maintainer":"Andrew Chapple <AndrewChapple21@gmail.com>","Description":["Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a","Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive","formulation for the spatial dependency in the hazard rates for each piece.","This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of split","points to vary and also uses Stochastic Search Variable Selection to determine","what covariates drive the risk of the event.

It also allows problems with p>n and p>>n and also incorporates routines to handle problems with variable selection with factors.","Acknowledgements":["since version 1.9.0 BayesVarSel uses the non-exported","function get_rdX from package lmerTest (distributed under","GPL-2, GPL-3) and authored by Alexandra Kuznetsova, Per Bruun","Brockhoff and Rune Haubo Bojesen Christensen."],"Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"TRUE","URL":"https://github.com/comodin19/BayesVarSel","BugReports":"https://github.com/comodin19/BayesVarSel/issues","SystemRequirements":"GNU Scientific Library","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Packaged":"2020-02-18 07:11:42 UTC; gonzalo.garciadonato","Author":["Gonzalo Garcia-Donato [aut],","Anabel Forte [aut, cre],","Carlos Vergara-Hernández [ctb]"],"Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2020-02-18 07:50:02 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/BayesVarSel_2.0.1.tar.gz"},{"Package":"bayesvl","Version":"0.8.5","Depends":["R (>= 3.4.0), rstan (>= 2.10.0), StanHeaders (>= 2.18.0),","stats, graphics, methods"],"Imports":"coda, bnlearn, ggplot2, bayesplot, viridis, reshape2, dplyr","Suggests":"loo (>= 2.0.0)","License":"GPL (>= 3)","MD5sum":"e3ebd478547c0153206516b4488612ca","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":["Visually Learning the Graphical Structure of Bayesian Networks","and Performing MCMC with 'Stan'"],"Date":"2019-05-20","Authors@R":"c(person(\"Viet-Phuong\", \"La\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), email = \"lvphuong@gmail.com\"), person(\"Quan-Hoang\", \"Vuong\", role = c(\"aut\"), email = \"hoang.vuongquan@phenikaa-uni.edu.vn\"))","Author":["Viet-Phuong La [aut, cre],","Quan-Hoang Vuong [aut]"],"Maintainer":"Viet-Phuong La <lvphuong@gmail.com>","Description":"Provides users with its associated functions for pedagogical purposes in visually learning Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations.

The four types of models supported are binormal, two component constrained, two component unconstrained, and four component.  The most general model is the four component model, under which both cases and controls are distributed according to a mixture of two unimodal distributions.  In the four component model, the two component distributions of the control mixture may be distinct from the two components of the case mixture distribution.  In the two component unconstrained model, the components of the control and case mixtures are the same; however the mixture probabilities may differ for cases and controls.  In the two component constrained model, all controls are distributed according to one of the two components while cases follow a mixture distribution of the two components.  In the binormal model, cases and controls are distributed according to distinct unimodal distributions.  These models assume that Box-Cox transformed case and control data with a common lambda parameter are distributed according to Gaussian mixture distributions.   Model parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  Likelihood ratio test comparison of nested models can be performed using the lr.test function. AUC and PAUC values can be computed for the model-based and empirical ROC curves using the auc and pauc functions, respectively. The model-based and empirical ROC curves can be graphed using the roc.plot function. Finally, the model-based density estimates can be visualized by plotting a model object created with the bimixt.model function.

This program is also applicable to the situation of two evenly spaced time series that are not on the same time grid. 'BINCOR' is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee (2010, 2014) to estimate the correlation between two climate time series with different timescales. The idea is that autocorrelation (AR1 process) allows to correlate values obtained on different time points. 'BINCOR' contains four functions: bin_cor() (the main function to build the binned time series), plot_ts() (to plot and compare the irregular and binned time series, cor_ts() (to estimate the correlation between the binned time series) and ccf_ts() (to estimate the cross-correlation between the binned time series).","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2018-05-21 13:21:33 UTC","Packaged":"2018-05-18 14:00:07 UTC; jomopo","Repository":"CRAN","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/BINCOR_0.2.0.tar.gz"},{"Package":"binda","Version":"1.0.3","Depends":"R (>= 3.0.2), entropy (>= 1.2.1)","Imports":"graphics, stats, utils","Suggests":"crossval","License":"GPL (>= 3)","MD5sum":"dc26dc3bb2941d167c25272a5b1730f7","NeedsCompilation":"no","Date":"2015-07-07","Title":"Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis using Binary Predictors","Author":"Sebastian Gibb and Korbinian Strimmer.","Maintainer":"Korbinian Strimmer <strimmerlab@gmail.com>","Description":["The \"binda\" package implements functions for multi-class","discriminant analysis using binary predictors, for corresponding","variable selection, and for dichotomizing continuous data."],"URL":"http://strimmerlab.org/software/binda/","Packaged":"2015-07-07 16:47:44 UTC; strimmer","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2015-07-08 00:33:03","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/binda_1.0.3.tar.gz"},{"Package":"bingat","Version":"1.3","Depends":"R (>= 3.1.0)","Imports":["matrixStats, network, gplots, doParallel, foreach, parallel,","vegan, stats, graphics"],"License":"Apache License (== 2.0)","MD5sum":"36880c9471862d7a9b96c0d934a1d50b","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":"Binary Graph Analysis Tools","Date":"2017-07-05","Author":"Terrence Brooks, Berkley Shands, Skye Buckner-Petty, Patricio S.

Gas composition, cumulative production, or other variables can be interpolated to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane production (and rates) can be calculated using volumetric, manometric, gravimetric, or gas density methods for any number of bottles. With cumulative methane production data and data on bottle contents, biochemical methane potential (BMP) can be calculated and summarized, including subtraction of the inoculum contribution and normalization by substrate mass. Cumulative production and production rates can be summarized in several different ways (e.g., omitting normalization) using the same function. Biogas quantity and composition can be predicted from substrate composition and additional, optional data. Lastly, inoculum and substrate mass can be determined for planning BMP experiments.","Packaged":"2019-12-26 11:14:28 UTC; sasha","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2020-01-08 12:40:06 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/biogas_1.23.2.tar.gz"},{"Package":"biogeo","Version":"1.0","Depends":"R (>= 3.1.0)","Imports":"raster, stringr, maptools, vegan, sp","Suggests":"dismo (>= 0.9-3)","License":"GPL (>= 3)","MD5sum":"4d1c63a843e07c2da8c78ae1081ce947","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":"Point Data Quality Assessment and Coordinate Conversion","Date":"2016-03-10","Author":"Mark Robertson","Maintainer":"Mark P.

The Ordinary Least Square regressions (OLSv and OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the (Correlated)-Bivariate Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS) can be used with unreplicated or replicated data. The BLS() and CBLS() are the two main functions to estimate a regression line, while XY.plot() and MD.plot() are the two main graphical functions to display, respectively an (X,Y) plot or (M,D) plot with the BLS or CBLS results. Four hyperbolic statistical intervals are provided: the Confidence Interval (CI), the Confidence Bands (CB), the Prediction Interval and the Generalized prediction Interval. Assuming no proportional bias, the (M,D) plot (Band-Altman plot) may be simplified by calculating univariate tolerance intervals (beta-expectation (type I) or beta-gamma content (type II)). Major updates from last version 1.0.0 are: title shortened, include the new functions BLS.fit() and CBLS.fit() as shortcut of the, respectively, functions BLS() and CBLS(). References: B.G.

The 'brglmFit' fitting method can achieve reduction of estimation bias by solving either the mean bias-reducing adjusted score equations in Firth (1993) <doi:10.1093/biomet/80.1.27> and Kosmidis and Firth (2009) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asp055>, or the median bias-reduction adjusted score equations in Kenne et al. (2017) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx046>, or through the direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>. See Kosmidis et al (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09860-6> for more details. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial responses (both ordinal and nominal), the adjusted score approaches to mean and media bias reduction have been found to return estimates with improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete separation; see Kosmidis and Firth, 2020 <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa052>, for a proof for mean bias reduction in logistic regression).

Examples of the fields include clinical trials where the statistical classification of patients is indispensable to predict the clinical courses of diseases. Considering the negative impact of diseases on performing daily tasks, correctly classifying patients based on the clinical information is vital in that we need to identify patients of the high-risk group to develop a severe state and arrange medical treatment for them at an opportune moment. Deep learning - a part of artificial intelligence - has gained much attention, and research on it burgeons during past decades: see, e.g, Kazemi and Mirroshandel (2018) <DOI:10.1016/j.artmed.2017.12.001>. It is a veritable technique which was originally designed for the classification, and hence, the Buddle package can provide sublime solutions to various challenging classification and regression problems encountered in the clinical trials. The Buddle package is based on the back-propagation algorithm - together with various powerful techniques such as batch normalization and dropout - which performs a multi-layer feed-forward neural network: see Krizhevsky et. al (2017) <DOI:10.1145/3065386>, Schmidhuber (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003> and LeCun et al. (1998) <DOI:10.1109/5.726791> for more details. This package contains two main functions: TrainBuddle() and FetchBuddle(). TrainBuddle() builds a feed-forward neural network model and trains the model. FetchBuddle() recalls the trained model which is the output of TrainBuddle(), classifies or regresses given data, and make a final prediction for the data.","LazyData":"TRUE","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","Packaged":"2020-02-11 13:27:23 UTC; Jason","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2020-02-13 09:30:10 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Buddle_2.0.1.tar.gz"},{"Package":"buildmer","Version":"1.7.1","Depends":"R (>= 3.2)","Imports":"graphics, lme4, methods, mgcv, nlme, plyr, stats, utils","Suggests":["GLMMadaptive, MASS, gamm4, glmertree, glmmTMB, knitr,","lmerTest, nnet, ordinal, parallel, partykit, pbkrtest,","rmarkdown"],"License":"FreeBSD","MD5sum":"92c91113c6adbf709312d6ea90857964","NeedsCompilation":"no","Title":["Stepwise Elimination and Term Reordering for Mixed-Effects","Regression"],"Authors@R":"person(c(\"Cesko\", \"C.\"), \"Voeten\", email = \"cvoeten@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), comment = c(ORCID=\"0000-0003-4687-9973\"))","Description":["Finds the largest possible regression model that will still converge","for various types of regression analyses (including mixed models and generalized","additive models) and then optionally performs stepwise elimination similar to the","forward and backward effect-selection methods in SAS, based on the change in","log-likelihood or its significance, Akaike's Information Criterion, the Bayesian","Information Criterion, the explained deviance, or the F-test of the change in R²."],"Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","BugReports":"https://github.com/cvoeten/buildmer/issues","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Packaged":"2020-08-25 06:47:37 UTC; Cesko","Author":"Cesko C.

Given a set of predictors, each of which may have a shape or order restrictions, the maximum likelihood estimator for the constrained generalized additive model is found using an iteratively re-weighted cone projection algorithm. The ShapeSelect routine chooses a subset of predictor variables and describes the component relationships with the response. For each predictor, the user needs only specify a set of possible shape or order restrictions. A model selection method chooses the shapes and orderings of the relationships as well as the variables. The cone information criterion (CIC) is used to select the best combination of variables and shapes. A genetic algorithm may be used when the set of possible models is large. In addition, the cgam routine implements a two-dimensional isotonic regression using warped-plane splines without additivity assumptions.  It can also fit a convex or concave regression surface with triangle splines without additivity assumptions.

The hypothesis test generates a p-value or permutation-based FDR value with confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in the causal inference.

The use of copula functions allows modeling a wide range of multivariate dependencies between the phenotypes, and previous results are supporting that C-JAMP can increase the power of association studies to identify associated genetic variants in comparison to existing methods (Konigorski, Yilmaz, Pischon, 2016, <DOI:10.1186/s12919-016-0045-6>; Konigorski, Yilmaz, Bull, 2014, <DOI:10.1186/1753-6561-8-S1-S72>).

Typically these models must assess the probability of every possible combination of (ancestor state, left descendent state, right descendent state).  This means that there are up to (# of states)^3 combinations to investigate, and in biogeographical models, there can easily be hundreds of states, so calculation time becomes an issue.  C++ implementation plus clever tricks (many combinations can be eliminated a priori) can greatly speed the computation time over naive R implementations.

Due to the small effect sizes of common variants, the power to detect individual risk variants is generally low. Complementary to SNP-level analysis, a variety of gene-based association tests have been proposed. However, the power of existing gene-based tests is often dependent on the underlying genetic models, and it is not known a priori which test is optimal.  Here we proposed COMBined Association Test (COMBAT) to incorporate strengths from multiple existing gene-based tests, including VEGAS, GATES and simpleM. Compared to individual tests, COMBAT shows higher overall performance and robustness across a wide range of genetic models.

The methods differ from past approaches by accounting for the level of clinical treatment efficacy overall and in biomarker response subgroups, which enables the correlates of risk results to be interpreted in terms of potential correlates of efficacy/protection. The methods also account for inter-individual variability of the observed biomarker response that is not biologically relevant (e.g., due to technical measurement error of the laboratory assay used to measure the biomarker response), which is important because power to detect a specified correlate of risk effect size is heavily affected by the biomarker's measurement error. The methods can be used for a general binary clinical endpoint model with a univariate dichotomous, trichotomous, or continuous biomarker response measured in active treatment recipients at a fixed timepoint after randomization, with either case-cohort Bernoulli sampling or case-control without-replacement sampling of the biomarker (a baseline biomarker is handled as a trivial special case). In a specified two-group trial design, the computeN() function can initially be used for calculating additional requisite design parameters pertaining to the target population of active treatment recipients observed to be at risk at the biomarker sampling timepoint. Subsequently, the power calculation employs an inverse probability weighted logistic regression model fitted by the tps() function in the 'osDesign' package. Power results as well as the relationship between the correlate of risk effect size and treatment efficacy can be visualized using various plotting functions. To link power calculations for detecting a correlate of risk and a correlate of treatment efficacy, a baseline immunogenicity predictor (BIP) can be simulated according to a specified classification rule (for dichotomous or trichotomous BIPs) or correlation with the biomarker response (for continuous BIPs), then outputted along with biomarker response data under assignment to treatment, and clinical endpoint data for both treatment and placebo groups.","BugReports":"https://github.com/mjuraska/CoRpower/issues","Encoding":"UTF-8","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","LazyData":"true","Packaged":"2020-11-17 01:24:39 UTC; mjuraska","Author":["Stephanie Wu [aut],","Michal Juraska [aut, cre],","Peter Gilbert [aut],","Yunda Huang [aut]"],"Maintainer":"Michal Juraska <mjuraska@fredhutch.org>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2020-11-17 08:10:14 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/CoRpower_1.0.4.tar.gz"},{"Package":"corrcoverage","Version":"1.2.1","Depends":"R (>= 3.5.0)","Imports":"data.table, magrittr, stats, matrixStats, Rcpp","LinkingTo":"Rcpp, RcppArmadillo","Suggests":"covr, dplyr, knitr, mvtnorm, rmarkdown, testthat, pkgdown","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","OS_type":"unix","MD5sum":"c2b6655bb17d5deb9c5d710cf85c2e94","NeedsCompilation":"yes","Type":"Package","Title":["Correcting the Coverage of Credible Sets from Bayesian Genetic","Fine Mapping"],"Authors@R":["c(","person(\"Anna\", \"Hutchinson\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), email = \"anna.hutchinson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk\"),","person(\"Chris\", \"Wallace\", role = c(\"aut\")),","person(\"Kevin\", \"Kunzmann\", role = c(\"ctb\"))",")"],"Maintainer":"Anna Hutchinson <anna.hutchinson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>","Description":["Using a computationally efficient method, the package can","be used to find the corrected coverage estimate of a credible set","of putative causal variants from Bayesian genetic fine-mapping.","The package can also be used to obtain a corrected credible set","if required; that is, the smallest set of variants required such","that the corrected coverage estimate of the resultant credible set is","within some user defined accuracy of the desired coverage.","Maller et al.

The quadratic exponential model is suitable for the analysis of binary longitudinal data when state dependence (further to the effect of the covariates and a time-fixed individual intercept) has to be taken into account. Therefore, this is an alternative to the dynamic logit model having the advantage of easily allowing conditional inference in order to eliminate the individual intercepts and then getting consistent estimates of the parameters of main interest (for the covariates and the lagged response). The simplified version of this model does not distinguish, as the original model does, between the last time occasion and the previous occasions. The modified version formulates in a different way the interaction terms and it may be used to test in a easy way state dependence as shown in Bartolucci, F., Nigro, V. & Pigini, C. (2018, Econometric Reviews) <DOI:10.1080/07474938.2015.1060039>.

Serotype identification is the most commonly used typing method to characterize Salmonella isolates. However, experimental serotyping needs great cost on manpower and resources. Recently, we found that the newly incorporated spacer in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) could serve as an effective marker for typing of Salmonella. It was further revealed by Li et. al (2014) <doi:10.1128/JCM.00696-14> that recognized types based on the combination of two newly incorporated spacer in both CRISPR loci showed high accordance with serotypes. Here, we developed an R package 'CSESA' to predict the serotype based on this finding.

The flagship idea of 'DataVisualizations' is the mirrored density plot (MD-plot) for either classified or non-classified multivariate data published in Thrun, M.C. et al.: \"Analyzing the Fine Structure of Distributions\" (2020), PLoS ONE, <DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0238835>. The MD-plot outperforms the box-and-whisker diagram (box plot), violin plot and bean plot and geom_violin plot of ggplot2. Furthermore, a collection of various visualization methods for univariate data is provided. In the case of exploratory data analysis, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through a combination of four methods. One of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of the probability density function (pdf). Additionally, visualizations of the distribution of distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot using PDE for two variables as well as the Shepard density plot and the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. Pertaining to classified high-dimensional data, a number of visualizations are described, such as f.ex. the heat map and silhouette plot. A political map of the world or Germany can be visualized with the additional information defined by a classification of countries or regions. By extending the political map further, an uncomplicated function for a Choropleth map can be used which is useful for measurements across a geographic area. For categorical features, the Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots, improved by the ABC analysis, become usable.

The author's intention was to create a toolbox, which facilitates the (notoriously time consuming) first descriptive tasks in data analysis, consisting of calculating descriptive statistics, drawing graphical summaries and reporting the results. The package contains furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned.

The pre-fit methods apply on binomial-response generalized liner models such as logit, probit and cloglog regression, and can be directly supplied as fitting methods to the glm() function. They solve the linear programming problems for the detection of separation developed in Konis (2007, <https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8f9ee0d0-d78e-4101-9ab4-f9cbceed2a2a>) using 'ROI' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ROI> or 'lpSolveAPI' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=lpSolveAPI>.

The post-fit methods successively refit the model with increasing number of iteratively reweighted least squares iterations, and monitor the ratio of the estimated standard error for each parameter to what it has been in the first iteration. According to the results in Lesaffre & Albert (1989, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345845>), divergence of those ratios indicates data separation.","URL":"https://github.com/ikosmidis/detectseparation","BugReports":"https://github.com/ikosmidis/detectseparation/issues","Encoding":"UTF-8","LazyData":"true","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Packaged":"2020-03-23 17:11:43 UTC; yiannis","Author":["Ioannis Kosmidis [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1556-0302>),","Dirk Schumacher [aut],","Kjell Konis [ctb]"],"Maintainer":"Ioannis Kosmidis <ioannis.kosmidis@warwick.ac.uk>","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2020-03-25 16:00:02 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/detectseparation_0.1.tar.gz"},{"Package":"deTestSet","Version":"1.1.7.2","Depends":"R (>= 2.01), deSolve","Imports":"graphics, grDevices, stats","License":"GPL","MD5sum":"a5ac16f918f9bf7be9fa197112b251de","NeedsCompilation":"yes","Title":"Test Set for Differential Equations","Authors@R":["c(person(\"Karline\",\"Soetaert\", role = c(\"aut\",\"cre\"), ","email = \"karline.soetaert@nioz.nl\"),","person(\"Jeff\",\"Cash\", role = \"aut\",","email = \"j.cash@imperial.ac.uk\"),","person(\"Francesca\",\"Mazzia\", role = \"aut\",","email = \"mazzia@dm.uniba.it\"),","person(\"Ernst\",\"Hairer\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"files dopri8.f, dopri6.f\"),","person(\"Gerard\",\"Wanner\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"files dopri8.f, dopri6.f\"),","person(\"T.\",\"Abdulla\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"file mebdfi.f\"),","person(\"Cecilia\",\"Magherini\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"files bimd.f, bimda.f\"),","person(\"Luigi\",\"Brugnano\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"files bimd.f, bimda.f\"),","person(\"Cleve\",\"Moler\", role = \"ctb\",","comment = \"file bimda.f\")",")"],"Maintainer":"Karline Soetaert <karline.soetaert@nioz.nl>","Author":["Karline Soetaert [aut, cre],","Jeff Cash [aut],","Francesca Mazzia [aut],","Ernst Hairer [ctb] (files dopri8.f, dopri6.f),","Gerard Wanner [ctb] (files dopri8.f, dopri6.f),","T.

This method was developed to address a concern within dendroclimatology that young trees may produce a differing climate response to older more established trees. Details of this method are available in  Pirie, M. (2013). The Climate of New Zealand reconstructed from kauri tree rings: Enhancement through the use of novel statistical methodology. PhD. Dissertation, School of Environment and Department of Statistics, University of Auckland, New Zealand. This package also produces a figure with 3 panels, each panel is for a different climate variable. An example of this figure in included in \"On the influence of tree size on the climate - growth relationship of New Zealand kauri (Agathis australis): insights from annual, monthly and daily growth patterns. J Wunder, AM Fowler, ER Cook, M Pirie, SPJ McCloskey. Trees 27 (4), 937-948\". For further R functions for loading your own dendroclimatology datasets and performing dendrochronology analysis refer to the R package \"dplR: Dendrochronology Program Library in R\".

It is articulated entirely around trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays are bivariate plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or related quantities as ordinates. Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be modelled as a continuous flow of biomass surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic levels, due to predation and ontogenic processes. Such an approach, wherein species as such disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic level metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but potentially useful caricature of ecosystem functioning and impacts of fishing.

As an example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain and/or through the control of fat storage in the adipose tissue by dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue. We present a method eGST (eQTL-based genetic subtyper) that integrates tissue-specific eQTLs with GWAS data for a complex trait to probabilistically assign a tissue of interest to the phenotype of each individual in the study. eGST estimates the posterior probability that an individual's phenotype can be assigned to a tissue based on individual-level genotype data of tissue-specific eQTLs and marginal phenotype data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohort. Under a Bayesian framework of mixture model, eGST employs a maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the tissue-specific posterior probability across individuals.

This package provides cross-validation wrappers to allow for downstream application of ensemble integration techniques, including best-error selection. All base learner estimation objects are retained, allowing for repeated prediction calls without the need for re-training. For large problems, an option is provided to save estimation objects to disk, along with prediction methods that utilize these objects.

The functional F-test proposed in Causeur, Sheu, Perthame, Rufini (2018, submitted) for analysis of variance issues in ERP designs is implemented for signal detection (tests for mean difference among groups of curves in One-way ANOVA designs for example). Once an experimental effect is declared significant, identification of significant intervals is achieved by the multiple testing procedures reviewed and compared in Sheu, Perthame, Lee and Causeur (2016, <DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888>). Some of the methods gathered in the package are the classical FDR- and FWER-controlling procedures, also available using function p.adjust. The package also implements the Guthrie-Buchwald procedure (Guthrie and Buchwald, 1991 <DOI:10.1111/j.1469-8986.1991.tb00417.x>), which accounts for the auto-correlation among t-tests to control erroneous detection of short intervals. The Adaptive Factor-Adjustment method is an extension of the method described in Causeur, Chu, Hsieh and Sheu (2012, <DOI:10.3758/s13428-012-0230-0>). It assumes a factor model for the correlation among tests and combines adaptively the estimation of the signal and the updating of the dependence modelling (see Sheu et al., 2016, <DOI:10.1214/15-AOAS888> for further details).","URL":"http://erpinr.org","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Packaged":"2019-12-13 10:52:21 UTC; causeur","Repository":"CRAN","Date/Publication":"2019-12-13 11:30:06 UTC","RPackageURL":"http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ERP_2.2.tar.gz"},{"Package":"erp.easy","Version":"1.1.0","Depends":"R (>= 3.2.0)","Imports":"plyr (>= 1.8.3), signal (>= 0.7-6), gtools (>= 3.5.0)","License":"GPL-3","MD5sum":"7420797048c544d17c1dcf034b42c4d3","NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","Title":"Event-Related Potential (ERP) Data Exploration Made Easy","Authors@R":["person(\"Travis\", \"Moore\", email = \"travis.m.moore@vanderbilt.edu\", ","role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))"],"URL":"https://github.com/mooretm/erp.easy","Description":["A set of user-friendly functions to aid in organizing, plotting","and analyzing event-related potential (ERP) data.

(2) The ESEA package can can quantify the change of correlation between genes for each edge based on gene expression data with cases and controls. (3) The ESEA package uses the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to calculate an edge enrichment score (EES), which reflects the degree to which a given pathway is associated the specific phenotype.
